# Differences from main
- Basic shopping list added with proper categories and default items
- CSV file added that will contain all of the user's items and their attributes

# Functionality to be added next
- Create a javascript function that can read the contents of the csv file and build the shopping list from that. After this is complete, it should be much easier to manage the user's items from page to page.
- Additional functions will be added in order to modify the csv file (deleting items, changing information, etc.)
